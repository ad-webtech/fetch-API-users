# Fetch and Display User Data (JavaScript Fetch API)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to **fetch data from a public API** using JavaScript’s Fetch API and display it on a webpage.  
The user list is fetched from **[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)** and displayed as interactive cards.  
Clicking on a user card opens a **detailed profile page** for that user.
